About this project:

    This project will study 21K images of cassava leaves with the corresponding disease classes. The goal is to build a model to predict the cassava leaf disease classification. There are five disease classes. class 0: Cassava Bacterial Blight disease, class 1: Cassava Brown Streak Disease, class 2: Cassava Green Mottle disease, class 3: Cassava Mosaic Disease disease, class 4: Healthy. The type of learning is deep learning and the type of task is multi-class image classification.

    The deep learning models that will be used are CNN and vgg16.

    CNN is a convolution neural network that utilizes neural networks to learn features or patterns from images for recognition and classification.

    VGG16 is a deeper formate of the CNN model. It has 16 layers.

 Data Source: 

  The dataset is from a Kaggle project named ' Cassava Leaf Disease Classification'.

 Dataset: 
  
  The dataset contains train images, test images and train_labels.csv. The train and test images are cassava plant images. The train image has 21K+ images and the test image has 1 image. All images are in 800 x 600 dimensions, stored in a directory structure with a .jpg extension.

  The train_labels.csv corresponds with the train image. It is tabulated data and has a data size of 21K rows and 2 columns. Each row is an image and the 2 columns are the image id and labels of the image.
